## StockX Scraper
A program to get all StockX URL's and then scrape the info from each given URL

### About
These scripts allow a 2-step approach for:
1) Getting all URL's by brand, make, and year
2) From the list of URL's scrape all information.

Currently the process to scrape all URL's and product info is very time consuming. Also, there is an occasional "Verify" button that may come up that I've just manually clicked for now.

### Dependencies
```python
time
json
pandas
bs4
selenium
```
